# MMFENDWeatherApp
 Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree Weather App Project


## Overview
This project requires the student to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. The project uses data from OpenWeatherMap and user input of zipcode and a short entry on how the user is feeling to generate a User interface entry.


## Instructions From Udacity Assignment
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

### Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.

## App Use Instructions
* Clone the repository   
* Run <b>npm start</b> in root directory
* Open <b>localhost:8080</b> in your browser
* Enter valid US Zip Code, your feelings and click 'Generate' to view response.
